# Task Master Framework Prompt
## Overview
This document outlines a system that given a high-level idea, automatically generates a project folder structure and supporting files to accelerate solution development.  The system leverages AI-driven prompts and best practices for modern applications.

## Tech Stack
./prompts/tech-stack.md

## Idea
- Refer to ./prompts/idea.md

## Context
- use the files in the ./docs folder: prd.md, idea.md, goals.md, readme.md, tech-stack.md, etc.

## Workflow
- Input: user provides a high-level idea or goal.
- Prompt Engine: AI coding assistant interprets the idea and generates:
    - recommended tech stack
    - project folder structure
    - initial configuration and documentation files
- Output: a ready-to-use project project scaffold, including:
    - environment
    - requirements, configuration files
    - source code, tests, and data directories
    - Documentation, references, issues, task tracking files

## Tasks
- Set up the files and folders found in the 'folder-structure.md' prompt file.
- Review the idea. Split it into managable milestones. Update the tasks.
- Run the development environment.
- Set up test framework (eg. tech-stack specific and Playwright)
- Prepare for git
