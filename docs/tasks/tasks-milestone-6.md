# Milestone 6: Hint System

## Goal
Add hint buttons for each problem type that provide helpful guidance without revealing answers.

## Tasks

### 6.1 UI Components
- [x] Add hint button to each problem type section
- [x] Design tooltip/popover component for displaying hints
- [x] Style hint button with icon (lightbulb) and text
- [x] Position hint button appropriately in each problem card
- [x] Make tooltip dismissible (click outside or close button)

### 6.2 Hint Content - Slope Problem
- [x] Create step-by-step guidance hints
- [x] Add formula reminders (slope formula)
- [x] Include conceptual explanations (rising, falling, horizontal, vertical)
- [x] Ensure hints don't reveal the answer

### 6.3 Hint Content - Relationship Problem
- [x] Create step-by-step guidance hints
- [x] Add formula reminders (parallel = same slope, perpendicular = negative reciprocal)
- [x] Include conceptual explanations (parallel, perpendicular, neither)
- [x] Ensure hints don't reveal the answer

### 6.4 Hint Content - Parallel Line Problem
- [x] Create step-by-step guidance hints
- [x] Add formula reminders (parallel lines have same slope)
- [x] Include conceptual explanations (how to find parallel line through point)
- [x] Ensure hints don't reveal the answer

### 6.5 Hint Content - Perpendicular Line Problem
- [x] Create step-by-step guidance hints
- [x] Add formula reminders (perpendicular = negative reciprocal slope)
- [x] Include conceptual explanations (how to find perpendicular line through point)
- [x] Ensure hints don't reveal the answer

### 6.6 Implementation
- [x] Create hint data structure for each problem type
- [x] Implement tooltip display logic
- [x] Add event listeners for hint buttons
- [x] Handle tooltip show/hide functionality
- [x] Ensure tooltip works on mobile/tablet

### 6.7 Testing
- [x] Test hint display for all four problem types
- [x] Verify tooltip positioning and styling
- [x] Test tooltip dismissal
- [x] Verify hints don't reveal answers
- [x] Test on different screen sizes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All four problem types have hint buttons
- [x] Hints show step-by-step guidance, formulas, and concepts
- [x] Tooltip displays all hints at once
- [x] Hints are helpful but don't reveal answers
- [x] Tooltip is dismissible and works on all devices
