# Issue #004: Test Celebration Buttons Not Working

**Date:** 2025-11-09 20:30:00  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** Medium

## Description
Clicking the "Test Confetti" and "Test Fireworks" buttons in the Developer Tools section does not trigger the celebration animations.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, potential issues identified:
1. Event listeners may not be finding the buttons (timing issue)
2. Confetti elements may need initial top position set
3. Missing error handling and debugging

## Solution
1. Added explicit button element checks with error logging
2. Added initial `top: '-10px'` position for confetti elements to ensure proper starting position
3. Added console.log statements for debugging
4. Added error handling for missing containers

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
- **app.js**:
  - Added explicit button element checks before adding event listeners
  - Added console.log statements to track button clicks
  - Added error logging if buttons or containers are not found
  - Added initial top position for confetti elements

### Testing
- Verify buttons are found in DOM
- Verify event listeners are attached
- Verify animations trigger when buttons are clicked
- Check browser console for any errors

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Added debugging and improved error handling for test buttons
