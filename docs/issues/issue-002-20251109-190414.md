# Issue #002: Spam Clicking Submit Button to Gain Points

**Date:** 2025-11-09 19:04:14  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Users can spam click the submit button after answering a question correctly to gain multiple points for the same answer. This exploits the scoring system and breaks game integrity.

## Root Cause
The submit button handlers call `updateStats()` every time they're clicked, without checking if the current question has already been answered. There's no mechanism to prevent multiple submissions of the same question.

## Solution
Add a flag to track if the current question has been answered:
- Set `questionAnswered` flag to `true` after first submission
- Check this flag before processing any submission
- Reset the flag when starting a new question (tab change, input field change, etc.)
- Optionally disable submit button after answer is shown

## Fix Applied
1. Added `questionAnswered` flag to gameState
2. Check flag in all problem handler functions before processing
3. Reset flag when:
   - User switches tabs
   - User changes input in any field
   - New question is started
4. Set flag to true after first submission

## Testing
- Test spam clicking submit button - should only award points once
- Test switching tabs - should reset and allow new submission
- Test changing input - should reset and allow new submission
- Test all four problem types

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Added questionAnswered flag and checks in all handlers
