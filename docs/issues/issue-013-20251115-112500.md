# Issue #013: Distractors Too Complex for 8th Grade

**Date:** 2025-11-15T11:25:00  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Multiple choice distractors (wrong answers) were generating overly complex values that are not appropriate for 8th grade students. For example, slopes like `-27/10` or other complex fractions were appearing as options, making the questions unnecessarily difficult.

## User Feedback
> "the answers are way too unnecessary, make them easier for the 8th grade mind to understand. for example the image above has -27/10 which is (in my opinion) too much"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **`generateSlopeDistractors()`**: Using `randomFloat()` and reciprocals (`1/correctSlope`) without constraints
2. **Complex Reciprocals**: Calculating `1/correctSlope` for any slope resulted in complex fractions (e.g., if slope = -10/27, reciprocal = -27/10)
3. **Random Variations**: Using `randomFloat(-1, 1)` created messy decimal values
4. **No Constraints**: No limits on denominator size or value complexity

## Solution
Simplified distractor generation to focus on **common student mistakes** with **simple, age-appropriate values**:

1. **Limited Value Set**: Use only simple values (0, ±1, ±2, ±3, common fractions like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, etc.)
2. **Common Mistakes**:
   - Wrong sign (most common: multiply by -1)
   - Off by 1 (add/subtract 1)
   - Flipped fraction (reciprocal) only if it results in a simple fraction (denominator ≤ 5)
3. **Predictable Patterns**: Use deterministic mistakes instead of random variations
4. **Simple Equation Distractors**: For parallel/perpendicular lines, use simple integer offsets

## Changes Made
- **app.js**:
  - Completely rewrote `generateSlopeDistractors()`:
    * Added `simpleValues` array of age-appropriate values
    * Focus on wrong sign, off by 1, and simple reciprocals only
    * Constrain reciprocals to denominators ≤ 5
    * Fall back to common simple values if needed
  - Simplified `generateEquationDistractors()`:
    * Use simple integer offsets (1, -1, 2, -2, 3) instead of random floats
    * Remove `randomFloat()` usage
    * Use deterministic mistake patterns

## Testing
- [x] Build completed successfully
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Distractors now use simple, 8th-grade-appropriate values
- [x] Complex fractions like -27/10 eliminated
- [x] Focus on pedagogically sound mistakes

## Impact
- Improves age-appropriateness of questions
- Focuses on common student misconceptions (wrong sign, off-by-one errors)
- Reduces cognitive load, allowing students to focus on concepts, not complex arithmetic
- Better educational experience for 8th graders

## Examples of Improvements

**Before:**
- Slope options: `2/3`, `-27/10`, `1.47`, `undefined`

**After:**
- Slope options: `2/3`, `-2/3`, `3/2`, `1`

**Before:**
- Parallel line equations with complex slopes and intercepts

**After:**
- Parallel line equations with simple integer offsets
