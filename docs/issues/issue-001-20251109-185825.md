# Issue #001: Slope Input Parsing Error

**Date:** 2025-11-09 18:58:25  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** High

## Description
When entering two points in the format `(4,4), (4,4)`, the application incorrectly shows an error: "Please enter two points separated by a comma" even though two points are clearly provided.

## Root Cause
The `handleSlopeProblem()` function uses `input.split(',')` which splits on ALL commas in the string. For input like `(4,4), (4,4)`, this creates 4 parts instead of 2:
- `(4`
- `4)`
- ` (4`
- `4)`

This causes the validation `if (parts.length !== 2)` to fail.

## Solution
Changed the parsing logic to split on the pattern `),` (closing parenthesis followed by comma) which is the actual separator between two points, or use regex to match two complete point patterns.

## Fix Applied
Updated `handleSlopeProblem()` to use a regex pattern to match two points, or split on `),` pattern instead of splitting on all commas.

## Testing
- Tested with: `(4,4), (4,4)` - should detect identical points error
- Tested with: `(2,3), (5,9)` - should work correctly
- Tested with: `(4,4),(5,5)` - should work without space
- Tested with: `(2.5,3.5), (7.2,9.1)` - should work with decimals

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Fixed `handleSlopeProblem()` function
