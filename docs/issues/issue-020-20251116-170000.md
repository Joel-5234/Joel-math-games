## Problem Description

User reported: "the speed runner and lightning fast achievements are the same things. fix this and add more achievements"

From screenshot:
- **Speed Runner**: "Answer any question correctly in under 10 seconds"
- **Lightning Fast**: "Answer a question correctly in under 10 seconds"

These are duplicates! Same trigger condition, just different wording.

## Current Achievements List

From screenshot visible achievements:
1. Slope Master - Answer 20 slope questions correctly with no mistakes
2. Parallel Pro - Answer 10 relationship questions correctly
3. Perpendicular Pro - Answer 10 perpendicular questions correctly
4. Speed Runner - Answer any question correctly in under 10 seconds ← DUPLICATE
5. Focus 10 - Answer 10 questions correctly in a row in one session
6. Homework Hero - Score 100 points in one session
7. Lightning Fast - Answer a question correctly in under 10 seconds ← DUPLICATE
8. Speed Demon - (partially visible, need to check code)

## Root Cause

Speed Runner and Lightning Fast have the same trigger logic in the code. Need to differentiate them or remove one.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Fix Duplicate:**
   - Keep "Lightning Fast" for single quick answer (< 10 seconds)
   - Change "Speed Runner" to multiple quick answers (e.g., 5 questions under 10 seconds each)

2. **Add More Achievements:**
   - Problem type specific achievements (Linear Functions, Intercepts, etc.)
   - Accuracy-based achievements (Perfect 10, Flawless)
   - Streak-based achievements (Hot Streak, Unstoppable)
   - Challenge completion achievements (Challenge Champion)
   - Time-based achievements (Marathon Runner, Sprint Master)
   - Practice-based achievements (Dedicated Student, Practice Makes Perfect)
