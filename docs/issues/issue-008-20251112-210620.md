## Description
After implementing Milestone 14 (Vertical Navigation Bar), the sidebar navigation bar is not displaying on desktop screens. The sidebar should be visible on the left side of the page with all 9 problem type tabs.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `.nav-sidebar` element lacked explicit grid positioning and display properties:
1. No explicit `display: block` property for desktop view
2. No explicit grid column/row positioning
3. Grid items were not explicitly placed, relying on automatic placement which may not work correctly
4. Main content and stats sidebar also lacked explicit grid positioning

## Solution
Added explicit grid positioning and display properties with increased specificity:
1. Added `display: block !important` to `.nav-sidebar` for desktop
2. Added `grid-column: 1` and `grid-row: 2` to `.nav-sidebar`
3. Added `grid-column: 2` and `grid-row: 2` to `.main-content`
4. Added `grid-column: 3` and `grid-row: 2` to `.sidebar` (stats sidebar)
5. Added `visibility: visible`, `opacity: 1`, and `z-index: 10` to ensure visibility
6. Added `min-height: 400px` to ensure sidebar has proper height
7. Updated media query to use `:not(.active)` selector to prevent conflicts
8. Added explicit `grid-row: 1` to header for proper placement

## Changes Made

### styles.css
- Added `display: block` to `.nav-sidebar`
- Added `grid-column: 1; grid-row: 2;` to `.nav-sidebar`
- Added `grid-column: 2; grid-row: 2;` to `.main-content`
- Added `grid-column: 3; grid-row: 2;` to `.sidebar`

## Testing
- Build completed successfully
- No linter errors
- Grid layout now explicitly places all three columns:
  - Column 1: Navigation sidebar (240px)
  - Column 2: Main content (flexible)
  - Column 3: Stats sidebar (300px)

## Verification Steps
1. Open application in browser
2. Verify navigation sidebar appears on left side
3. Verify all 9 tabs are visible and functional
4. Verify main content appears in center
5. Verify stats sidebar appears on right
6. Test responsive behavior on mobile/tablet

## Notes
- Grid layout: `grid-template-columns: 240px 1fr 300px`
- Header spans all columns: `grid-column: 1 / -1`
- All grid items now have explicit positioning for reliability
