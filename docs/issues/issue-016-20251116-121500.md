# Issue #016: Auto-Advance Not Working After Submitting Answer in Challenge Mode

**Date**: 2025-11-16 12:15:00  
**Status**: Investigating  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Reported By**: User  
**Assigned To**: AI Assistant

## Problem Description

User reported: "submitting the awnser doesn't go to the next problem anymore"

Screenshot shows Challenge Mode with:
- Question 1 of 25 
- Correct answer selected (option D: -3, highlighted in green)
- Classification also answered correctly (A: falling, highlighted in green)
- But the challenge did not auto-advance to question 2

## Expected Behavior

After submitting an answer in Challenge Mode:
1. Answer is processed and marked correct/incorrect
2. Options are highlighted (green for correct, red for incorrect)
3. After 2 seconds, automatically advance to next question
4. Display next question

## Actual Behavior

- Answer is processed correctly
- Options are highlighted correctly
- No auto-advance occurs
- User stays on the same question

## Investigation

Checked `submitChallengeAnswer()` function (lines 1892-1895):
```javascript
// Auto-advance after a delay
setTimeout(() => {
    navigateChallengeQuestion('next');
}, 2000);
```

The auto-advance code IS present and looks correct.

Possible causes:
1. JavaScript error preventing setTimeout from executing
2. Issue in `navigateChallengeQuestion()` function
3. Issue in `hideHints()` called at start of navigation
4. Console errors blocking execution
5. Event listener or state issue

## Root Cause Analysis

**Testing needed**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors.

**Hypothesis 1**: The `hideHints()` function may not exist or may throw an error, preventing navigation.

**Hypothesis 2**: There may be a timing issue or race condition with the new dual timer system (Milestone 17).

**Hypothesis 3**: An error in the question generation (Issue #015 fix) may be causing navigation problems.

## Testing Plan

1. Check for `hideHints()` function existence
2. Add console logging to track execution
3. Test in browser console
4. Check for JavaScript errors
5. Verify `navigateChallengeQuestion()` is being called

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix implemented
- [ ] Auto-advance works after 2 seconds
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] Manual testing passed
- [ ] Issue documented
- [ ] Code deployed

## Related Issues

- Milestone 17: Dual Timer System (recently completed)
- Issue #015: Complex fractions fix (recently completed)
- Possible regression from recent changes

## Notes

This is a critical issue as it blocks the core functionality of Challenge Mode. Users cannot progress through challenges without manual navigation.
