# Issue #003: Missing "Get Hint" Button in Challenge Mode

**Date:** 2025-11-09 19:55:00  
**Status:** Fixed  
**Priority:** High

## Description
The "Get Hint" button was not visible in Challenge Mode, preventing users from accessing hints during challenges.

## Root Cause
The challenge interface was implemented without hint functionality. The hint system was only available in practice mode, and the challenge interface lacked:
- Hint button in the challenge interface
- Two-column layout to display hints
- Hint panel for challenge mode
- Hint tracking and scoring logic

## Solution
Implemented full hint functionality for Challenge Mode:
1. Added hint tracking to challengeState (hintsUsed, hintsUsedPerQuestion, hintLimit: 5)
2. Updated challenge interface to use two-column layout (like practice mode)
3. Added hint button to challenge interface header
4. Added challenge-specific hint panel in right column
5. Implemented hint usage tracking (max 5 hints per challenge)
6. Modified scoring to halve points when hint is used
7. Updated completion summary to show hint usage statistics

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- Added `hintsUsed`, `hintsUsedPerQuestion`, and `hintLimit` to challengeState
- Initialize hint tracking when challenge starts
- Reset hint tracking when challenge resets

### UI Changes
- Updated challenge interface to use flexbox two-column layout
- Added hint button with count display: "Hints: X/5"
- Added challenge-hint-panel in right column
- Hint button disabled when limit reached

### Scoring Logic
- Modified `updateChallengeStats()` to check if hint was used
- If hint used: award Math.floor(config.baseScore / 2) points instead of full points
- Track hint usage per question for accurate scoring

### Completion Summary
- Added "Hints Used: X/5" to completion statistics
- Display hint usage alongside other challenge statistics

## Testing
- Tested hint button appears in challenge mode
- Tested hint limit enforcement (5 hints max)
- Tested point penalty (halves points when hint used)
- Tested hint tracking across navigation
- Tested completion summary displays hint statistics
- Tested responsive layout with hints

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Added hint tracking, scoring logic, and hint display functions
- `index.html` - Updated challenge interface with two-column layout and hint panel
- `styles.css` - Added styles for challenge layout and hint count display
